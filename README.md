# Geofencing Sample App
This Android application is an example of how to implement Geofencing using the Android Geofencing API. The app allows users to create a geofence by selecting a location on a map and setting the radius. When the user enters or exits the geofence, a notification is displayed.

## Features
- The app uses Google Maps API to display the map.
- The user can long-press on the map to create a geofence.
- The user can set the radius of the geofence.
- When the user enters or exits the geofence, a notification is displayed.
